    "Question1 ➖  Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution ➖   The for loop is used when we already know the number of iterations, which means when we  know how many times a statement has to                        be executed . that is why we have to specify the ending point in the for loop initialization. When we need to end the loop on a                        condition other than the number of times, we use a while loop. \n",
